## 💬 About this project

I created this project because I wanted to learn 🧠 how to use the [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/) and the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) to make it easier to add closed captioning to your Twitch channel. There are some other apps and extensions that do closed captioning too, so [check them out](https://stream-cc.gooseman.codes/) 📢!
